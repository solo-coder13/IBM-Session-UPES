CNN is basically a model known to be Convolutional Neural Network and in the recent time it has gained a lot of popularity because of itâ€™s usefullness. CNN uses multilayer perceptrons to do computational works. CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means the network learns through filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. So, for image processing task CNNs are the best-suited option.
